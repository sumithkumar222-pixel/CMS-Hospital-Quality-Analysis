## Project Overview
This academic project analyzes hospital performance data from the **Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)** to identify key factors influencing hospital quality ratings.  
Using R programming, the study performs data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and regression modeling to determine how different domains—such as mortality, readmission, and patient experience—impact the overall hospital rating.

The results can help healthcare organizations focus on the most critical performance indicators to improve patient care and overall quality outcomes.

## Objectives
- Clean and preprocess the CMS hospital dataset.  
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and trends.  
- Visualize hospital performance metrics and overall ratings.  
- Build predictive models for hospital quality ratings.  
- Interpret results and provide actionable insights for improvement.
